# Reinforcement leanring - Q-Learning in Pygame 

GridWorld is a game where an agent navigates a grid to reach a goal while avoiding obstacles. The agent learns over time how to best navigate the grid by learning from its experience the implementation of the Q-learning algorithm. A visual animation of the agentâ€™s learning process is displayed using Pygame.
